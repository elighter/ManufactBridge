# RFC-003: ERP Integration Layer

## Summary

This RFC defines the design and implementation of the ERP Integration Layer that enables the ManufactBridge platform's integration with ERP systems. This layer will provide bidirectional, reliable, and scalable data flow between industrial data and ERP systems.

## Motivation

Integration between production systems and ERP systems is typically a complex, repetitive process that requires custom coding. This RFC aims to simplify this process by providing a standardized architecture, ready-made connectors, and easily configurable integration flows. This way, businesses will be able to exchange data between production systems and ERP systems with minimal custom coding.

## Design Details

### 1. ERP Integration Layer Architecture

The ERP Integration Layer will consist of the following core components:

1. **ERP Connectors**: Ready-made connectors for popular ERP systems like SAP, Odoo, ERPNext
2. **API Gateway**: A secure and manageable API layer for all external system integrations
3. **Data Transformation Service**: Converting UNS data to ERP format and ERP data to UNS format
4. **Workflow Engine**: For defining and managing complex integration processes
5. **Error Management**: Capturing failed operations, retry logic and compensating actions
6. **Monitoring and Logging**: Monitoring and reporting all integration traffic

+-------------------+      +------------------------+      +--------------------+
```

### 2. ERP Connector Architecture

A connector architecture containing the following standard layers will be created for each ERP system:

1. **Connection Manager**: Authentication, session management, and connection pooling
2. **Data Format Converter**: Conversion between JSON/XML and ERP formats
3. **Schema Mapper**: Mapping between UNS data schemas and ERP data schemas
4. **Workflow Adapter**: Transfer of business processes to ERP systems
5. **Error Handler**: Converting ERP-specific errors to standard errors

### 3. Supported ERP Systems and Communication Methods

The following ERP systems will be supported in the first phase:

- **SAP S/4HANA**: OData, RFC, BAPI, iDocs
- **Odoo**: XML-RPC, REST API
- **ERPNext**: REST API, Frappe Framework API
- **Microsoft Dynamics 365**: REST API, OData
- **Generic REST/SOAP**: General-purpose REST/SOAP integration

### 4. Data Integration Models

The ERP Integration Layer will support the following integration models:

- **Event-Driven**: Forwarding events from UNS to ERP
- **Scheduled**: Data synchronization at specific intervals
- **On-Demand**: Integrations initiated by user or system
- **Bidirectional**: Data flow from ERP to UNS and from UNS to ERP

### 5. ERP Integration Flow Configuration

ERP integration flows will be defined in YAML format:

```yaml
# erp-integration-flow.yaml example
integration:
  name: "production-order-sync"
  description: "Transfers production orders from SAP to ManufactBridge"
  enabled: true
  
source:
  type: "sap"
  connection:
    url: "${SAP_API_URL}"
    auth_method: "oauth2"
    client_id: "${SAP_CLIENT_ID}"
    client_secret: "${SAP_CLIENT_SECRET}"
  
  query:
    method: "OData"
    service: "/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_PRODUCTION_ORDER_SRV"
    entity: "ProductionOrder"
    filter: "CreationDate gt datetime'${LAST_SYNC_DATE}'"
    
transform:
  mapping:
    - source: "ProductionOrder"
      target: "order.id"
    - source: "Material"
      target: "order.product.id"
    - source: "PlannedQuantity"
      target: "order.quantity"
    - source: "MfgOrderScheduledStartDate"
      target: "order.scheduledStart"
      transform: "dateTimeFormat('yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss')"
      
destination:
  type: "uns"
  topic: "manufactbridge/acme/istanbul/productionOrders"
  messageType: "production-order"
  
error_handling:
  retry:
    attempts: 3
    interval: "exponential"
    max_interval: "5m"
  dead_letter_topic: "manufactbridge/errors/erp-integration"
```

### 6. Security and Authentication

The ERP Integration Layer will implement the following security mechanisms:

- OAuth2.0 / JWT-based authentication
- End-to-end encryption with TLS/SSL
- Data masking and protection of sensitive information
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Detailed audit logs

## Implementation Steps

1. Development of basic ERP Integration framework
2. Implementation of SAP OData and Odoo REST API connectors
3. Development of data transformation and mapping engine
4. Development of workflow and integration management components
5. Creation of error management and logging infrastructure
6. Integration of security and authentication mechanisms
7. Implementation of API Gateway
8. Development of example integration scenarios

## Alternatives

The following alternatives were evaluated:

1. **Commercial Integration Platforms**: Not suitable due to open source goals and cost
2. **Direct ERP API Usage**: Scalability, maintenance and error management issues
3. **ESB-Based Integration**: Too general-purpose and heavy for industrial data integration

## Conclusion

The ERP Integration Layer is a critical component that will enable the ManufactBridge platform to integrate industrial data with ERP systems. The modular and flexible design of this layer will enable easy integration with different ERP systems and support complex business scenarios.
