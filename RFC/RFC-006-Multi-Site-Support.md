# RFC-006: Multi-Site Support and Federation

## Summary

This RFC defines the Multi-Site Support and Federation architecture that enables the ManufactBridge platform to simultaneously manage multiple production facilities, sites, or factories. This architecture will enable central monitoring and management of systems in different geographical locations while preserving their local autonomy.

## Motivation

Today, most manufacturing companies operate in multiple facilities or different geographical locations. Although operations at each facility may be similar, local requirements, production processes, and infrastructure can vary significantly. This RFC aims to solve this challenge with a federation architecture that both preserves local autonomy and provides centralized monitoring, analysis, and management capabilities.

## Design Details

### 1. Federation Architecture

The Multi-Site Federation will consist of the following core components:

1. **Central Hub**: Central system that collects, monitors, and manages data from all sites
2. **Site Nodes**: ManufactBridge installations in each production facility that can operate locally
3. **Federation Layer**: Layer that provides synchronization and communication between the central hub and sites
4. **Site Management API**: API services for remote site management and configuration
5. **Federation Data Management**: Rules that govern which data remains local and which is sent to the center

                        |                   |
                        |   CENTRAL HUB     |
                        |                   |
                        +----+------+-------+
                             |      |
                    +--------+      +--------+
                    |                        |
           +--------v-------+      +---------v------+
           |                |      |                |
           |  SITE-1        |      |  SITE-2        |
           |                |      |                |
+----------+  UNS           |      |  UNS           +----------+
|          |  Edge          |      |  Edge          |          |

+----------+----------------+      +----------------+----------+
```

### 2. Federation Synchronization Modes

The following synchronization modes will be supported between site nodes and the central hub:

1. **Real-Time**: Instant transfer of critical data to the center
2. **Periodic**: Data synchronization at specific intervals
3. **Event-Based**: Data transmission only when specific events or conditions occur
4. **Data Summary**: Sending summary data instead of raw data
5. **On-Demand**: Data transmission upon request from the central hub

### 3. Offline Operation and Fault Tolerance

The federation architecture will ensure that sites continue to operate even during internet connection outages:

1. **Local Autonomous Operation**: Site nodes can operate fully functional even without connection
2. **Data Buffering**: Data is buffered locally during connection outages
3. **Automatic Synchronization**: Data is automatically synchronized when connection is restored
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Intelligent resolution of conflicting data
5. **Priority Synchronization**: Priority transmission of the most important data when connection is limited

### 4. Security and Authorization

Multi-layered security model for federation architecture:

1. **Centralized Identity Management**: Single authentication and authorization for all sites
2. **Role-Based Access**: Site, department, and role-based access control
3. **Secure Communication**: Encrypted communication with TLS/mTLS
4. **Data Security**: Encryption and masking of sensitive data
5. **Data Sovereignty**: Rules for keeping certain data within local boundaries

### 5. Federation Data Model

The federation architecture will provide basic data model standardization while allowing sites to have certain autonomy in their data structures:

1. **Common Data Model**: Compatible basic data model across all sites
2. **Local Extensions**: Site-specific data model extensions
3. **Data Mapping**: Transformation from local data to central model
4. **Schema Evolution Management**: Management of data model changes
5. **Metadata Catalog**: Centralized metadata management for all sites

### 6. Federation Configuration Example

## Implementation Steps

1. Design and implementation of federation protocol and APIs
2. Development of Central Hub components
3. Development of federation adapters for site nodes
4. Implementation of offline operation and data buffering mechanisms
5. Development of federation data model and transformation rules
6. Security and authorization system integration
7. Development of site management and monitoring interfaces
8. Preparation of federation example configurations

## Alternatives

The following alternatives were evaluated:

1. **Fully Centralized Architecture**: Managing all sites from a single central system - Rejected due to lack of local autonomy and fault tolerance
2. **Fully Independent Sites**: Independent operation of each site - Rejected due to lack of centralized monitoring and management
3. **Hybrid Cloud Solution**: Cloud-based central hub - Rejected due to lack of cloud connectivity or security policies in some industrial environments

## Conclusion

The Multi-Site Support and Federation architecture will enable the ManufactBridge platform to adapt to complex organizational structures in real-world production environments. This architecture will provide both local autonomy and fault tolerance while offering centralized monitoring, management, and analysis capabilities.
